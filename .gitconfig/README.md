# My .gitconfig

This repository contains my git config.

Feel free to use it and become as lazy as me =)

---

## How to use

1. Place the `.gitconfig` where you usually would.

(find out the location of your config using the `git config --list --show-origin` command)

ðŸš€ You are now ready to go (and be lazy)! ðŸš€
