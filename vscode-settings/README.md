# What does this repository contain?

This repository contains my personal Visual Studio Code settings.

Feel free to copy!

I actually recommend you to synchronize your settings by logging into VSCode...

I'm highly certain my VSCode settings on GitHub will be outdated by the time you are reading this ;)
